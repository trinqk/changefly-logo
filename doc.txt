---------
main.dart
---------
  DESCRIPTION:
  - File to run runApp() which inflates given widget and attaches it to screen
  - Entry point of a Flutter app
  
  @class BasicFlutterApp
    - sets up device orientation
    - sets up the app by returning a MaterialApp which is then used in runApp()
    - sets the home of MaterialApp to @class Changefly which is imported (changefly.dart)



--------------
changefly.dart
--------------
  DESCRIPTION:
  - This is where we return the pageview which controls what the user sees
  - We also create an [AnimationController] in this file to control the animation

  @class Changefly
    * AnimationController _controller   used to control the animation. Used 
                                        in our FAB to reset and play animation

    * int animationDuration             controls the length of the animation
                                        we pass this into the _controller

    * PageController _pageController    Used to control the page that is viewed
    
    * int _currentIndex                 current index of _pageController 
                                        Used to show user which index they are orientation

    - sets up the _controller and _pageController
    - sets up PageView so user may swipe to see different logos
    - sets up FAB(floating action button) so clicking it will cause animation restart
    - PageView includes @class ChangeflyAnimation (changefly_animation.dart)
                      & @class ChangeflyAnimation (changefly_animation2.dart)

  DESCRIPTION:
  - Assembles the whole logo which is split into two seperate components
    * LogoCube (logo/cube_animation.dart) *
    * LogoHeader (logo/header_animation.dart) *
  - Returns the first animation which is shown by changefly.dart

  @class ChangeflyAnimation
    * AnimationController controller   AnimationController passed in from changefly.dart

    * Curve animationCurve             Used to define the animation curve needed for animation

    - basically puts the two components into a column 
    - passes the controller onto the other two components
